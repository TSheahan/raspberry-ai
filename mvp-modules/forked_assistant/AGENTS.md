# forked_assistant — Agent Context

## What This Is

Active development of a two-process voice assistant architecture for Raspberry Pi 4. The recorder child (pinned to core 0) owns the microphone and runs the Pipecat pipeline. The master process (cores 1–3) runs the cognitive loop (STT → Claude → response handling). They communicate via SharedMemory (audio data) and Pipe (control signals).

This design solves the single-process shutdown crash documented in `archive/step7/`.

## Start Here

**`spec/implementation_framework.md`** is the guiding document for this effort. It defines the effort unit (EU) phasing, dependency graph, session principles, reference code pointers, and the file layout roadmap. Read it before starting any implementation session. The other specs (`architecture.md`, `interface_spec.md`, `recorder_state_spec.md`, `stub_contracts.md`) contain the technical design — the framework doc tells you how to approach the work.

## Implementation Phasing (Effort Units)

| EU | Description | Status |
|----|-------------|--------|
| EU-1 | SharedMemory smoke test | Complete (`test/smoke_test_shm.py`) |
| EU-2 | Ring buffer module | Complete (`src/ring_buffer.py`, tested in smoke_test) |
| EU-3a | RecorderState base class | Complete (`src/recorder_state.py`) |
| EU-3b | Track 1: IPC harness (fork + real SHM/pipe, no Pipecat) | Complete (`test/track1_ipc_harness.py`) |
| EU-3c | Track 2: Pipeline harness (real Pipecat + stub IPC) | Complete (`test/track2_pipeline_harness.py`) |
| EU-3d | Merge: Track 1 + Track 2 into real recorder child | Complete (`src/recorder_child.py`, `test/test_harness.py`) |
| EU-4 | Master process — batch mode (STT + Claude) | Ready for Pi test (`src/master.py`) |

EU-3b and EU-3c are **parallel tracks** that can be developed independently. EU-3d merges them.

## Hard Constraints (from step 7 crash analysis)

These are proven failure modes. Do not relax them:

1. **Stream ops (stop/start) must be async tasks**, never synchronous from Pipecat callbacks → PortAudio deadlock / USB fault
2. **OWW full 5-buffer reset on every ungate transition** → false-positive wake detections without it
3. **Silero LSTM reset before first frame of new capture** → stale hidden states contaminate utterance
4. **No concurrent ONNX workloads** → OWW and Silero in non-overlapping phases only
5. **Every FrameProcessor subclass must override `process_frame`** and call both `super().process_frame()` and `push_frame()` → silent frame swallowing otherwise

## Import Convention

Test files add `sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..', 'src'))` to resolve `src/` imports. This supports direct execution: `python test/smoke_test_shm.py` from the `forked_assistant/` directory.

## What's Next

### EU-4 — ready for Pi test

`src/master.py` is written and ready for first Pi run. Test sequence:

1. `cd ~/raspberry-ai/mvp-modules/forked_assistant && source ~/pipecat-agent/venv/bin/activate`
2. Ensure `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` is set (export or `~/.env`)
3. `python src/master.py`
4. Say "hey Jarvis", speak a question, pause — expect transcript + Claude response
5. Repeat for 3+ turns to confirm stability
6. Ctrl+C from any state — expect clean exit, no Pi reboot

**Success criteria (from implementation_framework.md):** Complete voice turn (wake → capture → STT → Claude → return to listening) across the process boundary. Survive 3–5 consecutive turns without degradation. Clean shutdown from any state.

### EU-5 — future

Streaming STT extension. Not required for first working delivery.

## Completed Effort Units

### EU-3d — complete (2026-04-02)

Merged recorder child passed on Pi: 2 full wake→capture→VAD cycles with correct ring spans (61440 / 59520 bytes, ~1.9s each), Ctrl+C mid-wake-listen on 3rd cycle with clean shutdown. All success criteria met.

### EU-3b — complete (2026-04-02)

Track 1 IPC harness (`test/track1_ipc_harness.py`) passed on Pi. SharedMemory, Pipe, fork, core pinning, and shutdown all validated with synthetic audio.

### EU-3c — complete (2026-04-02)

Track 2 pipeline harness (`test/track2_pipeline_harness.py`) passed on Pi including async OWW predict. Duty cycle: 6% budget utilization, 0 frames over 20ms budget.
